- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The concept of OOP in Python focuses on creating reusable code. An object-oriented paradigm is to design the program using classes and objects. The object is related to real-word entities such as book, house, pencil, etc. The oops concept focuses on writing the reusable code. It is a widespread technique to solve the problem by creating objects.

# Class

A class is a collection of instance variables and related methods that define a particular object type. You can think of a class as an object's blueprint or template. Attributes are the names given to the variables that make up a class.

A class instance with a defined set of properties is called an object. As a result, the same class can be used to construct as many objects as needed.

- Classes are the building blocks in Object Oriented Programming.

- Classes can be seen as blueprints from which you create your Instances.
