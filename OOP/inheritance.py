# todo: Inheritance
'''
    A software modelling approach of OOP enables extending of an existing class to build a new class, 
    instead of building from scratch. In OOP terminology, this characteristic is called inheritance,
    the existing class is called base or parent class, while the new class is called child or sub class.

    * paren class is the being inherited from, also called base class
    * child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

    Inheritance comes into picture when a new class possesses that 'Is a' relationship with an existing class.

    # Benefits of inheritance
        - code reusability, readability, and scalability
        - reduction of code repetition
        - placement of all the standard methods and attributes in the parent class ensures accessibility by the child class derived from it.
        - Division of the code into multiple classes, makes the applications look better, and the error identification is easy.
        - well representation of real-world relationships
        - transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.

    # types of inheritance
        - single inheritance
            - in which there is one base class and one derived class
        - multiple inheritance
            - A class can be derived from more then one base classes
        - multilevel inheritance
            - we can inherit a derived class from another derived class
        - hybrid inheritance
            - hybrid inheritance involves multiple inheritance taking place
        - hierarchical inheritance
            - In which there is single base class and multiple derived class
