# ======== Variable and their type ======== #
# In python we don't need to declare data type. it define itself.
a = " shuvro baset" #string type data
print(a,type(a))
b = ' habijabi' #string type data
print(b,type(b))
c = 75 # int type data
print(c,type(c))
d = 4.75 # float type data
print(d,type(d))
e = True # boolean type data
print(e,type(e))

# there are some others data type in python like list, touple, dictionary we will discuss it later.
